### SMS Notification system
The SMS Notification system sends a notification about the job status and pending work via SMS. It checks the server for the status of each job whether it is completed, pending or if a new job is available. It also informs the officer of upcoming deadlines and higher priority jobs. A notification is sent once every three hours regarding the job status. 

This system uses the Bot cloud **Heroku**.The link for the Bot cloud is https://heroku.com
